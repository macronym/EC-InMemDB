# How to run the code

1. Install Python 3.12 if not already installed, since that's what I used.
2. Run ```python in_mem_db.py``` or click a run button in the IDE.
3. Test cases are provided within the same file through unittest, and it closely follows the example given in the assignment document.

# Potential modifications to become an official assignment

1. Add other methods to complete the transaction such as deleting a single key-value pair. 
2. Add complexity by implementing a more real-world database such as money transactions, airport schedules, etc., which would contain more columns and a combination of data types.
3. Clarify within the 'Grading' section what constitutes 'working code', or provide test cases. 
4. Instead of providing a Java blog post, provide a Python blog post as Python is easier to read and comprehend.
